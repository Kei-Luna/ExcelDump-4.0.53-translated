    "JJANNCIOOBE": "\"Yakov, what did the commander say to you that's got you so down?\"\\n\"Well, the waves were really choppy, so I slipped and fell while carrying the device. Fortunately, I was quick enough to save it...\"\\n\"But the commander still gave me an earful and ordered our squad to do signal reception tests. I mean, ugh, that's the toughest job around...\"\\n\"Oh come on, don't feel so down. We've done this stuff a hundred times before. Hey, chin up! Go get yourself something to eat!\"\\n\\n\"Agafya, Persikov has ordered us to perform some signal reception tests. Looks like all four of us have to go... Chevka will probably get mad at me.\"\\n\"Come on, Yakov, orders are orders, Chevka isn't going to blame you for them!\"\\n\"...You know what, if you're that scared, I'll go with you to talk to Chevka, alright?\"\\n\\n\"Well, look who's back. Pfft. Well, at least you didn't wreck the device or anything.\"\\n\"But...\"\\n\"Bah, it was just a signal reception test, not the end of the world.\"\\n\"See? Chevka doesn't mind!\"\\n\"Well... Guess I'll make preparations. We'll head out later!\"\\n\\n\"Two signal testing sets...\"\\n\"You know, I honestly thought that he was in serious trouble this time. Who knew this was just about being assigned slightly more annoying work! So yeah, that was a relief.\"\\n\"Hah! You should have seen how afraid he was of getting scolded by you. It was almost like watching a little brother cower at the thought of his older brother scolding him. Y'know... do you think he's just afraid of disappointing us? I mean, we're just squad-mates... but it does sometimes feel like we're family as well...\"\\n\"Family, huh...\"",
