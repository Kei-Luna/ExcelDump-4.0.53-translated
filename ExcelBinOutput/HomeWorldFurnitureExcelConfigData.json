It can also be used as a coffee table, and, with the aid of a cushion, can double as a chair.\\nThanks to its practical design, some Aaru Village residents place sumptuous refreshments on top of this table and store spare tea leaves and water bottles below to receive their guests with the highest courtesy. Of course, according to the rules of some families, a table that has been sat at cannot be used as a coffee table on the same day unless the cushions and tablecloths are replaced. Such families often keep a large number of rugs of different sizes at home and are key customers for merchants.",

The switch to Mountain Date Wood allows this design to be reproduced using the ideal materials.\\nOf course, given the high cost and fine workmanship, most people will use this vertical cabinet to store relatively expensive things such as books and delicate accessories. Therefore, some residents also use it as a showcase for their collections and thus place it in a more conspicuous position. \\nLegend has it that a few years ago, some Canned Knowledge smugglers had a misguided idea: to use intuition to hide important items by mixing containers and documents with clutter before storing them in plain sight within such cabinets. At first, this ruse actually fooled some ordinary matra who were following leads, but after the General Mahamatra updated their search procedures, listing all the tricks the suspects had played, all the peddlers who dared deceive the law were soon caught.",

Fortunately, a sellsword with long black and gold hair was also at the scene. Seeing through the trap, she kicked down the long table and used it as protection.

Although the main support structure of this round table is in the middle, it will never have trouble remaining stable no matter how worn it is. This is thanks to Margaret, the owner of the tavern, having stressed the various use cases of such tables while speaking to the craftspeople. For example, it has to be able to withstand a heavy fall by someone defeated in a TCG match, or the slam of hands on the table by drunk customers tickled pink by a friend's humor... And most importantly of all, it has to be able to hold the bulk of The Cat's Tail's collection of rather sturdy feline specimens as they leap from table to floor to table, and survive any incidental impacts that might occur as they play. As for the high costs that came with the reinforcement of the tables' central structures... Well, so long as the cats are happy, there's no price too high!",

Heavier armor provided more protection, yes, but it was a huge drain on the wearer's stamina and could not be put on quickly.\\nThe Shogun's army, equipped with such sturdy armor, was able to achieve battlefield superiority against the resistance for a time. Unfortunately, the samurai could not wear their armor indefinitely, and the resistance leadership caught on to the weaknesses in reaction and preparation time that these suits of armor imposed, engaging them with multiple forces on different fronts and using harassing tactics that forced the Shogunate forces many times into battles where there was no time to put their armor on. Subsequently, the Shogun's army also gradually switched to using lighter gear that allowed them to react quickly and engage the enemy flexibly.",

With the help of Canned Knowledge, she was able to impart secret new ways of processing clay to the potters in town while stipulating the suggested retail price of glazed pottery in her agreements, which would also earn her a fair sum for each piece successfully sold. Only within a few years, she defeated all her competitors utterly and made a huge fortune out of this, all while making glazed pottery much more available to ordinary households. The whole affair went on so quietly that even to this day, the merchants who used to sell glazed pottery as luxury items cannot figure out where went wrong. From their points of view, the potters all \"suddenly received guidance from an expert and disrupted the pottery market once and for all.\"\\nYet, as impressive as these machinations sound, the traveling merchant herself seems to almost forget about this.

After the Akademiya set restrictions on the price of clay, merchants had to discover other ways to make profits. Some of them had traveled afar to Liyue and noticed the similarities in the production between Liyue porcelain and Sumeru pottery. Hence, they spent a fortune purchasing the technical know-how behind Liyue-style porcelain, which later took Sumeru pottery into a brand new era. Of course, the pottery pieces made with such techniques were branded as imported luxury items by these merchants. The necessary techniques were not uploaded via the Akademiya to the Akasha System, which explains why glazed pottery was not a household item in the beginning.",

Such utensils are also known as \"treasure vases,\" implying that whatever is stored inside must be some kind of treasure.\\nIn the very beginning, residents in Sumeru would use a certain type of soil dug from the rainforests as raw materials to create all kinds of pottery. However, due to the insufficient content of certain minerals in such materials and the limitations of their craftsmanship, the lifespan of the pottery pieces produced then was fairly limited. After a few years, they tended to become incredibly brittle and fragile. Some potteries still produce this kind of earthenware and often sell them in bulk as the cheapest containers. The earliest batch of such pieces, however, have become rare collectors' items.",

For if one buys fully ripened Zaytun Peaches from Caravan Ribat, they would have already lost most of their moisture to the hot weather by the time they get to Aaru Village — indeed, they might even have rotted by then.\\nAs such, the villagers and the caravan merchants came together to think of a storage solution — first, they would wash as-yet unripe Peaches and scatter some specially-blended spices over them, before allowing them to soak inside barrels of wine. This way, all that is needed will be to bring the Zaytun Peaches back to Aaru Village before leaving them be for a while until the light alcohol on the surface volatilizes, thus giving the fruits a texture almost identical to what they would have had if freshly-picked and ripe. And if eaten the moment they are taken out from the wine barrel, one will get a uniquely crisp and refreshing flavor — a true Aaru Village special found nowhere else.",

According to that scholar, these plants can serve as a reminder to all students that despite the plants' ordinary appearance, they still had a place in the halls of the House of Daena, and the same applies to the students — as such, there is no need to dwell too much on their ancestry or wealth.

Though \"flower\" paints have the word flower in them, they tend to really be extracted from derivatives of common plants, such as Lavender Melon skins. Of course, some high-class paints do use traditional flowers as their base material. The source of the latter comes from items such as underwater colored stone and fish scales. There is no real difference in the price ranges of the two different types. Instead, the artist will choose between the two styles based on their understanding of the work they are doing. And since this drawing's theme is about rivers and streams, then one must naturally turn to the \"water\" colors to set the scene.",

Smoking, waxing, and other processes will increase the planks' hardness to their greatest extent, before mortise and tenon structures are used to join them together. They are then affixed on three relatively light and soft backplanes to form a double-layer composite structure, which tries to wear down incoming blades and arrows to the greatest extent possible, weakening their power and absorbing their impact. At the same time, the frame is covered with a rigid iron structure, while reinforcing structures are placed at the vertex of the shield arc to resist the impact of blunt objects and opposing shields — and with that, the shield is complete.\\nSuch shields are said to be able to fend off any attack from anyone without a Vision. Their price is also equivalent to dozens of ordinary weapons, which limits their users to small numbers of Eremite or Corps of Thirty elite troops.\\nTreasure Hoarders, who prioritize the lightness of their equipment, can't comprehend why a sellsword would invest so much in a shield like this. Only a select few frontline mercenaries and the designer of this shield type understand the importance of such equipment. As a reckless youth, the shield designer once led an incursion into Aaru Village in search of his colleagues' nemesis, only to be defeated by a young guard. With a shield in her left hand and a spear in her right, the guard with heterochromatic eyes was a human avalanche, shattering the intruders' weapons and defensive equipment alike in a single charge, knocking them out with just the right amount of force, before handing them over to the aged guards, admonishing them, and releasing them. The shield's designer, though now reformed and no longer a criminal, still remembers the young guard with her differently-colored eyes, regarding her as the strongest warrior he has ever met. She was the reference point from which the principle of \"the greatest offense is the greatest defense\" was used to transform this venerable shield design into this style of round shield.\\nAnd who knows?

Instead, it looks like waves of beautiful overlapping colors. But when calmly appreciating the portrait, you find that Mamere is conveying everything she wishes to express to you, layer by layer.\\nAccording to Seymour's evaluation, Mamere can create unique paintings that differ from the \"103,900 different styles of art.\" This makes her paintings priceless treasures, and those who gaze upon her paintings are always able to feel something different from Mamere's art each time they look at it.",

It is also the place where Yun Jin first performed the new edition of \"The Divine Damsel of Devastation.\" The stage features a classic design that has been passed down in the Yun-Han Opera Troupe for many generations. The structure and flooring are made from high-quality Fragrant Cedar Wood with meticulous workmanship, but thanks to the clever design, it is easy to set up and maintain, and can be transferred to other performance venues with less manpower. The circular design facilitates the arrangement of the guest seats, allowing each guest to maintain the best distance from the stage for a wonderful opera-listening experience.\\nIt is said that Yun-Han Opera Troupe built two stages: one for performances and one for practice and rehearsals. Yun Jin spends the majority of her time practicing on this stage, so much so that veteran artists can even find the shoe prints left behind by Yun Jin's tireless efforts at certain spots of the stage.",

Once, a self-claimed \"senior\" researcher in machinery even had an intense academic argument with an architecture researcher over a related discussion in front of a textile stall.

The clockwork meka used can only follow commands and repeat the production process, with no one to verify the final results of the dyeing process. The workers assembling the awnings afterward just followed their instructions and also failed to notice the color issue. When the designer finally saw the finished product, such a large quantity had already been produced as to making scrapping the project unfeasible. After making sure there were no quality issues, they were sold normally.\\nThis case became the subject of a paper from a certain research team at the Fontaine Research Institute, and subsequently became a key argument for the necessity of human supervision in clockwork meka-assisted production.",

This is how it should work in principle, but unfortunately, the laws of Inazuma may as well be muddy water to guests from overseas, and most outlander merchants steer clear of this austere mansion.\\nFortunately, a major incident that occurred recently has brought with it the chance for anyone's voice to reach Tenshukaku.

Safe and practical, these huts were originally developed by the inhabitants of Vimara Village and are used by the Forest Watchers as shelters when stationed in areas with more abundant rainfall.\\nOf course, being stationed in areas where such shelters are needed is also a test of spirit for the Forest Rangers, who must have a strong sense of responsibility and conviction.",

The wooden floorboards were dented by its sheer weight, and the spear's point was almost poking through the ceiling.\\nWhat? Was this some sort of strength-training tool? A performance prop intended to catch the eyes of onlookers? Or just some obstacle intentionally placed in the path of the test-taker?\\nYet the little guard said she did not mind, and simply carried the long spear out as if it were just another day. Deftly she hurled the spear, and what did they know? It landed just half a pace further than the previous Guardian's record\\nAfter this incident, some obstinate former Guardians never again said a word of doubt against that young girl. This may or may not have been because of the way she smiled at them when the test was over, not minding in the least where that spear might have come from...",

Whenever supplies are relatively abundant, the merchants who live in such residences may sometimes directly open their homes — and thereby their shops — and engage in barter trade with their neighbors.\\nOnce, there was a mischievous child who took advantage of just such a time to steal into the second floor of such a shop to find the mysterious treasure of the merchants, only to trip over some of the many goods stored there and sprain their ankle. There that child lay, crying till his throat was hoarse, and yet no one found him. Or rather, no one would have, if not for the keen senses Guardian with the mismatched eyes, who managed to find the lost child by daybreak, just in the nick of time. Though his family scolded him harshly, the Guardian patiently explained what the merchants were storing in their homes. The latter method of teaching worked much better, for now that the child's curiosity was sated, his more outrageous fantasies disappeared, and no other children would make this mistake from then on, or trouble the other villagers in such a manner.",

The main frame of the building is made from Cypress Wood supplemented with slag cement, a new material developed by the Fontaine Research Institute before the incident, giving it a very long lifespan.\\nThe Fontaine Research Institute was researching a unique method of construction — using a metal frame and cement to create a new wood-free building. These buildings would remain standing even if the Emperor of Fire and Iron caused a ruckus on the roof. However, Fontaine lacks the resources to produce the requisite quantities of metal with high enough load-bearing strength. For this reason, mass production of things such as clockwork meka was given priority for Fontaine's metallurgic resources. In light of this, construction with a metal frame and slag cement has not gained widespread popularity.",

It's one of the few buildings to utilize the metal frame and slag cement construction method, and even the gaps between the masonry are filled with a powerful adhesive. It is said that even a berserk clockwork meka going all out would have a hard time tearing it down.\\nAccording to a certain tabloid, when the Adventurers' Guild built its Fontaine branch, they took the possibility of repeated inspections by the Maison Gardiennage and the huge pressure the heavy clockwork meka would exert on the flooring into consideration. Furthermore, if conflict were to rise with the Maison Gardiennage or if a clockwork meka were to go out of control, half the building could easily be destroyed. Thus, the Adventurers' Guild was willing to invest a huge sum in a strong structure utilizing a metal frame.\\nWhen asked about it, the members of the Adventurers' Guild refused to comment on this or just responded with blank expressions. However, the local residents could clearly tell the relationship between the Adventurers' Guild and Maison Gardiennage was quite harmonious, nor was the building designed especially for the Adventurers' Guild. The article was seen as fabricating and spreading rumors. As a result, the author of the article soon became a pariah in Fontaine media industry.",

The residue and gas emission from smelting is processed multiple times to remove all harmful substances for reuse in the production of slag cement — a common construction material in Fontaine.

It is said that construction costs in Vasari Passage are relatively low due to the use of improved slag cement. Slag cement normally contains trace amounts of a smell reminiscent of powdered ore. While it may go unnoticed by the ordinary person, for those in the catering industry, it is highly detrimental to the long-term storage of goods. Thanks to the strict aromatic standards of a previous owner of Café Lucerne, and with the help of The Steambird and protests from many others in the industry throughout the city, researchers dared not ignore the issue and began researching an improved formula that removed the lingering odor.

Once construction using slag cement matured, architects believed rapid assembly of houses on a large scale was possible by making all the load-bearing walls in advance and using large clockwork meka to assist in construction.\\nHowever, despite many attempts to adjust the coloration, an icy cold and gloomy gray were the only possible outcomes for slag cement. Housing and indoor architecture would be far too plain if built like that, and so light yellow bricks are still necessary for the exterior wall panels while tiles or wood flooring are required indoors. Thus, concerns about aesthetics and livability won out over the time savings promised by modular construction. Thus, the architects turned to another form of modular construction design that focused on structure and reserving space for internal piping.\\nOf course, even if the architects succeed, there may not be much demand in Fontaine unless the Fontaine Research Institute is rebuilt — which is another complicated issue in itself...",

Its well-divided internal space can provide long-term accommodation for five to six single residents. Although its appearance is extremely plain, this building was actually one of the first to use the mature form of slag cement in its construction.\\nAccording to legend, the craftspeople of Fontaine attempted to promote Tearstone construction throughout Fontaine after the completion of the Opera Epiclese. Unfortunately, the extremely high costs that came with Tearstone were beyond the means of most Fontainians.\\nSo, they found a project team at the Fontaine Research Institute and requested the development of a construction material with similar strength to Tearstone that would be affordable for the general public. The researchers traveled in search of inspiration and finally found it in the process of smelting. They set out to design a \"stone\" that solidifies from a liquid form, and after decades of trial and error, they finally invented a cheap and resource-efficient material — slag cement.",

After the boutique became famous, other fashion outlets soon followed suit, but beyond the visual appeal, Chioriya's success lies in the excellent quality of its products. Just as its owner, Miss Chiori, began a fashion fad in Fontaine, the popularity of this metal-glass style of architecture also soared to new heights due to its many advantages.

While increasing its lifting efficiency, the crane also takes up very little space and shares many foundational components with other structures in the area. Therefore, it doesn't require a specialized technician to repair, which greatly lowers its construction and maintenance costs. Moreover, these cranes allow Port Ormos to accommodate a higher volume of cargo influx through an increased deployment rate while keeping the budget unchanged.",

After consulting with the Hydro Eidolon staff and Idyia herself regarding its intended usage, the director realized that since the mechanism would only see limited exposure during the play itself. \"In that case, why not make it cuter, so that maybe we can use it in other productions too!\" And thus, the big-eyed birds of the night, owls, were used as the basis for the mechanism. However, due to budgetary constraints and the limited labor available, this mechanism has only been used in one production...",

They were originally designed to remove junk, vegetation, and other underwater debris in order to prevent these from clogging up the vital parts of other clockwork meka, thereby minimizing failure rates. From another point of view, they are undoubtedly benefiting Fontaine's ecosystem greatly as underwater cleaners.\\nLegend has it that when maintenance meks were initially deployed, researchers made various demos to prove the technology for organizations like the Fishing Association, providing demo types along with instruction manuals. This was to explain the origin and features of this fish-shaped meka to the people of Fontaine, ensuring people wouldn't be confused or harmed when seeing them. However, the aggressiveness of the meka was overestimated, and the skill of the anglers underrated. With the disbandment of the maintenance project team, these technical demo meka are but decorations, offering a glimpse into the intriguing technological development of Fontaine.",

Due to the high-density Adhigama Wood used and the addition of very large metal spikes, the weight of this roadblock is frighteningly heavy, enough to stop the head-on charge of a Sumpter Beast. As such, these roadblocks are often dismantled and moved around, set up only when they are needed.\\nThat said, there was a certain mercenary with long black-and-golden hair who once opined that \"defensive lines were made to be broken,\" breaking through such obstacles en route to tearing the opposing side's defenses to shreds. This incident was so significant that even her colleagues started to consider installing some strengthening metal structures at the intersection of these roadblocks in order to deal with foes as powerful as her.",

Word has it that a certain senior angler spent a fortune on the tank so as to better appreciate the magnificent fish he had caught. Experts were specially hired to design the tank, the making of which even utilized Fontaine's most advanced technologies to fashion the tank out of a single piece of glass. Two pieces of curved glass bent at different angles were then used to form the sides of the fish tank, such that the size of the fish inside might be optically shrunk, allowing onlookers to move their eyes less when admiring his beloved fish.\\nIt's just that such large pieces of glass are of fairly limited strength.

The Practice Stakes can be placed anywhere within a limited area and will persist once placed. You can initiate the Practice Challenge at any time. If you can destroy all the wooden stakes in 2s, the challenge will be considered a success.\\n Interact with the Practice Plaque to check your records. After hearing the Traveler describe the training methods of certain adventurers, Tubby made this furniture combination for the Traveler to go a few rounds. After all, life in the Realm Within is very comfortable, and if you stay idle for too long, your fighting skills may slowly become rusty. Breaking multiple stakes is indeed easy, but if the stakes are spaced as far apart as possible, it is also a challenge to test one's speed and skill.\\nAim for \"breaking a large number of targets in a short period of time\" and start your training with ease.",

After interacting with the Seeker's Board, you can begin a treasure hunt or view hunt records. The Confuzzled Tubbers can be freely placed within a set space, where they will continuously remain. You can combine these placements with pre-existing furnishings within the Serenitea Pot to hide the Tubbers, after which you will have to search for these Tubbers within a time limit.\\nAfter hearing about Mondstadt's traditional game, Windtrace, from the Traveler, Tubby also resolved to create a game based around hide-and-seek, thus creating this particular furnishing combination. However, such a game that only involved Tubby, the Traveler, and Paimon would have too few people and thus lack a certain fun factor. As such, Tubby created many \"Confuzzled Tubber\" toys to play the role of other participants. Tubby even suggested that the Traveler could use adeptal energies to create playing fields and invite friends to come and experience the fun together.\\nIt seems that Tubby shares senses with the Confuzzled Tubbers, which can allow her to drink tea in peace within her teacup while enjoying the games.\\nNot that this has anything to do with Tubby growing both tubbier and lazier lately, of course.",

From another point of view, they are undoubtedly benefiting Fontaine's ecosystem greatly as underwater cleaners.\\nEquipped with high-sensitivity sensors, the meka can efficiently \"nose out\" target items through smells as well as detect the optical characteristics of underwater junk. As a result, they can be attracted by certain types of bait and are occasionally caught by anglers, who refer to them as \"Water Maintenance Fish\" or \"Iron Fish.\"\\nMade of light wood and cheap metal, this model represents the first batch of Maintenance Mek produced after achieving reliable manufacture, and possesses the fundamental capabilities required to fulfill the purpose for which they were designed. Their lifespan, however, is somewhat limited. To make up for that, this model was released in great numbers, and they work in \"group shifts\" – when one group stops functioning after reaching the end of their life cycle, another group that has been deployed underwater beforehand is then activated and takes the next shift.

The researchers responsible for this project introduced periodic callback and maintenance instead of just leaving them on their own after release. They would send out homing signals through flashing of a certain frequency in order to retrieve the meka, which they would then release again following maintenance and examination. Over time, certain individuals began to use this flashing method as a type of \"bait\" to catch these meka, and it is now widely known among the angling community.",

Over time, an increasing number were being damaged as a result. \\nTo protect the previous two models and ensure safe cleaning, researchers utilized existent frameworks and did their best to increase the power density of core structures. In the end, they developed a third model with certain combat capabilities, which was primarily designed to drive away underwater creatures by ramming into them. The new model was rapidly manufactured on the basis of previous processes.\\nHowever, the plan to further enhance \"Situation Controllers\" was suddenly terminated by the Fontaine Research Institute. After all, if these little things were capable of driving ferocious underwater creatures away, then what were all the other underwater meka for? In reality, these \"Situation Controllers\" were of no real use against the underwater creatures that actually posed a threat to the other meka, and could only deal with common fishes and damage the ecosystem. As a result, researchers had to shut down some of them intentionally and restrict their offensive capabilities.",

When trying to attract support from wealthy merchants for the Maintenance Mek project, the development team would send them a fish tank containing one of these exquisite contraptions as a gift – and fine gifts they were indeed! Unfortunately, none of these attempts worked, so the development team adjusted their plans and tried to sell them off as toys to make up for the lack of project funds instead.\\nIn the end, due to the accident that we all remember, the whole development team was dismissed and all of their future projects were canceled. At present, all of the remaining Maintenance Meks in Fontaine are totally unsupervised, and the \"Platinum Collection\" batch are no exception – they have all been lost to the water. Disappearing completely off the radar, they have turned out to be the most unique and expensive \"fishes\" in Fontaine. According to an in-depth investigation and cross-examination of the existing data by journalists of The Steambird, \"the deployment of Maintenance Meks has not made any significant difference to the pollution levels of Fontaine's waters, and the effect of the project is still in question.\" Nowadays, surviving \"Platinum Collection\" meks still wander the waters of Fontaine, and they are considered among the most prized of catches. After all, a \"Platinum Collection\" mek is now as rare as the most valuable Ornamental Fish in other nations.",
