But it seems like people in Fontaine are big coffee drinkers too!\\n<color=#37FFFF>kumadayo: </color>They sure are. Even the newspapers run articles about how great coffee is at keeping you awake and alert. And at boosting your energy levels, so you can keep performing at peak efficiency during a long working day.\\n<color=#37FFFF>Paimon: </color>Whew, any job where you need coffee to stay energized must be exhausting...\\n<color=#37FFFF>Paimon: </color>Like, umm... Blacksmiths? Maybe chefs too... And adventurers — they're always running around all over the place. Hey, and what about divers?\\n<color=#37FFFF>kumadayo: </color>Divers, huh? That's definitely the odd one out here...\\n<color=#37FFFF>kumadayo: </color>How are divers supposed to drink coffee when they work underwater the entire time?\\n<color=#37FFFF>Paimon: </color>Yeah, that's a good question!\\n<color=#37FFFF>Paimon: </color>They can't take off their helmets underwater, so they'd probably have to shut themselves inside an even bigger glass box and drain all the water out before they could finally drink their coffee. Probably from a bottle...\\n<color=#37FFFF>Paimon: </color>No, wait... If the coffee's already in a bottle, all they'd need is a long straw that goes from the bottle into their helmet. Then they'd be able to take a sip of coffee whenever they want!\\n<color=#37FFFF>kumadayo: </color>Hehe, eww, haha. But then the coffee would go cold!\\n<color=#37FFFF>kumadayo: </color>Cold coffee is just gross. With the important exception of iced coffee, but that's its own thing.\\n<color=#37FFFF>Paimon: </color>Well that's no problem. They can just bring a stove with them underwater.\\n<color=#37FFFF>Paimon: </color>You've seen the kind of stove that most people use in Fontaine, right? It only has one small opening up at the top. As long as that's sealed nice and tight, it won't go out even underwater!\\n<color=#37FFFF>Paimon: </color>Wait a second... No way, is that... That's it! That must be the whole reason stoves in Fontaine are made that way!\\n<color=#37FFFF>kumadayo: </color>Ding ding ding, right answer! That is indeed the reason behind the design of the Fontaine-style stove.\\n<color=#37FFFF>Paimon: </color>Hehe, Paimon's the smartest!\\n<color=#37FFFF>Paimon: </color>Hey, how about we open an underwater café? Paimon bets there's lots of divers out there craving some coffee while they're down in the depths... Yeah, this could be a huge opportunity for us!\\n<color=#37FFFF>Paimon: </color>Once we open the world's first-ever underwater café, the Mora will come rolling in! Heck, and why stop at cafés? The ocean's our oyster! We could build a whole shopping mall down there! Then a whole underwater business district...\\n<color=#37FFFF>Paimon: </color>Hee-hee! Ah, it's gotta be the best feeling in the world, making Mora through your very own stroke of business genius!\\n<color=#37FFFF>kumadayo: </color>Just one thing, okay? ...Don't go taking out a loan in my name!",

Maybe we'll be on the first few pages then? Surely, they've gotta put some real news in there. And it's gotta be interesting enough to keep people reading after they've gotten their dose of celebrity gossip. Right?\\n<color=#37FFFF>kumadayo: </color>The first few pages cover positive local news stories in the Court of Fontaine. Things like food and commodity prices going down, or progress updates on the aquabus expansions.\\n<color=#37FFFF>kumadayo: </color>They put these reports at the most prominent locations inside the newspaper. The point of them is mostly just to kill time.\\n<color=#37FFFF>kumadayo: </color>What goes on at the Akademiya might be important, but it doesn't directly impact the lives of people in Fontaine.\\n<color=#37FFFF>Paimon: </color>Huh... So, where would they put our stories then?\\n<color=#37FFFF>kumadayo: </color>I'd guess on the very back page, after everything else.\\n<color=#37FFFF>Paimon: </color>Aww... Why so far back!?\\n<color=#37FFFF>kumadayo: </color>I think they call it... \"saving the best till last.\"\\n<color=#37FFFF>kumadayo: </color>The editors probably embellish things a lot to flesh the story out, then break it into several chunks to make it into a series that runs over several days.\\n<color=#37FFFF>Paimon: </color>Alright, so... what's the \"point\" of the final page, then?\\n<color=#37FFFF>kumadayo: </color>It gives the newspaper its \"raison d'etre.\"",

It all aged Father greatly, and severely damaged the Kamisato Clan's standing within the Shogunate. Brother has worked tirelessly to reverse the trend since he assumed leadership, but although our clan's position is now restored and the Yashiro Commission is unified once more, we still rely on Brother to make the decisions on all matters of any importance.",

So I perform without hair and makeup whenever I have the option — and if I must perform in full dress, I try to select a costume that isn't too heavy.
